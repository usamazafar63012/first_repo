    <p>Buruli ulcer is an infectious disease characterized by the development of
         painless open wounds. The disease largely occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and 
         Australia, generally in rural areas near slow-moving or stagnant water. The 
         first sign of infection is a small painless nodule or area of swelling, 
         typically on the arms or legs. This grows larger over days to weeks, forming
          an open ulcer (biopsy images pictured). Deep ulcers can cause scarring of
           muscles and tendons, resulting in permanent disability. The World Health O
           rganization (WHO) recommends treating Buruli ulcer with a combination of the
            antibiotics rifampicin and clarithromycin. Regular cleaning and dressing of
             wounds aids healing and prevents secondary infections. In 2018, WHO received 
             2,713 reports of Buruli ulcer globally. In 1998, WHO established the Global 
             Buruli Ulcer Initiative to coordinate global efforts to eliminate Buruli ulcer. </p>
